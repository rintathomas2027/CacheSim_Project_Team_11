Algorithm: Least Frequently Used (LFU) Cache Replacement

1-Start

2-Initialize cache with fixed size C

3-For each memory reference R do:

4-If R is present in cache:

   Increment frequency count of R

5-Else (cache miss):
 
    If cache has free space:

      Insert R into cache

      Set frequency count of R to 1

  Else (cache full):

    Find the cache block with the lowest frequency count

    If multiple blocks have same lowest frequency:

      Select the oldest among them
   
   Remove the selected block

  Insert R into cache

  Set frequency count of R to 1

6-Repeat until all references are processed

7-Stop
