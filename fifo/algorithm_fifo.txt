## Algorithm (FIFO)
1. Initialize an empty cache array.
2. For each memory reference:
   - If the block is already in cache → Count as **Hit**
   - Else → **Miss**
     - If cache is full → Remove the oldest block
     - Insert the new block at the end
3. Display cache content after each access.
4. Calculate hits, misses, and hit ratio.
