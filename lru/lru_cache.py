LRU Algorithm =

Initialize an empty cache of fixed size.

For each memory reference:

If the block is already in cache → Hit

Move the block to the most recently used position.

Else → Miss

If cache is full:

Remove the least recently used block.

Insert the new block as the most recently used.

Display cache contents after each access.

Calculate=

Total Hits

Total Misses

Hit Ratio = Hits / Total References
